This project is about visualizing my google and internet history. I wish that you stumble upon this code and find a few insights with your own search history.

You can download your google search history on https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6068625?hl=en, or do a simple google search for "download google search history" and follow the first link. Now, this dataset is in JSON format. For the word cloud I use in my cide, you don't need to convert it into csv, but you will need to convert it if you want to do any other computations. The Internet history dataset can be generated easily. Just google it, you can either write a python code if you are good at itm or download some freeware, there are many. I used the one on http://www.nirsoft.net.

Once, you have your dataset ready, you are good to go.
